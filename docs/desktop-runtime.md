# Desktop Runtime

`apps/desktop/src-tauri` is an independent Cargo workspace that hosts the same persisted operations and ACP streaming capabilities as the Web server without running an HTTP server.

## Shared Backend and Commands

Desktop constructs one cloneable `ora-backend::Backend`. A shared command wrapper assigns a canonical
request id, opens the request span, invokes unary business logic, projects any backend error, and
records at most one completion event. Session load, prompt, and `watchAppEvents` operations use `stream_contract`, which
forwards ordered `data`, `error`, and `end` frames over a Tauri Channel. A private call id allows an
`AbortSignal` to cancel only that stream, while one separate request id correlates the complete stream.

The frontend injects `createTauriTransport()` into `createContractsClient`. The transport maps contract operation names to Tauri commands and forwards the original request DTO unchanged. Shared backend failures use the same direct `{ code, params, requestId }` payload as Web, without a public message or outer envelope. Tauri and fetch reuse the same runtime decoder; local Tauri invocation failures have no HTTP status and never invent a request id.

Task workspace lookup and Spec review are part of that shared contract surface. `get_task_workspace` returns the authoritative task root with an optional branch, while `get_spec_catalog` and `read_spec` delegate unary work to the shared backend. `watch_specs` and `watchAppEvents` use the same channel framing, cancellation, and exactly-once completion lifecycle as other Desktop streams.

Backend construction immediately attempts supervised `opencode acp`, `nga acp`, `codeagentcli acp`, `claude-agent-acp`, and `codex-acp` children in the user's home directory. Sessions share the connection selected by their current `agentCli` while retaining their own ACP session id and Task worktree `cwd`. `switch_session_agent` moves a live conversation to another CLI and `resume_session_history` recovers one whose history writes failed. Each CLI retries independently; failures leave the Desktop shell and healthy CLIs available, while operations targeting an unavailable CLI report `agent_runtime_unavailable`. Executable lookup is platform-specific — see [ACP Agent Runtime](agent-runtime.md).

The Desktop App Shell waits for the `Ready` frame before mounting normal queries and watchers. The native platform adapter grants application-window ownership immediately because Tauri owns one main window; browser hosts implement the same frontend seam with a Web Lock. The application stream itself is a multi-subscriber, best-effort session-title invalidation broadcast rather than a page lease or persisted event log.

Beyond the shared contract surface, Desktop registers four platform-only commands with no HTTP counterpart: `get_desktop_config`, `set_worktree_root`, `resolve_task_cwd`, and `open_location`.

One contract operation is not implemented on Desktop:

- listing a server filesystem directory.

No Tauri command exists for it. The contracts transport rejects it with `unsupported_operation` before any IPC call is made, so the exclusion is enforced client-side rather than by a stub command.

## Skill imports

Desktop exposes the shared import session lifecycle through four unary Tauri commands:
`prepare_skill_import`, `get_skill_import`, `commit_skill_import`, and `cancel_skill_import`.
The frontend sends the system picker's local path inside `PrepareSkillImportRequest`; the Rust
side reads the folder or archive, so file bytes (up to 200 MiB) are never serialized over Tauri
IPC. Preparation, preview, conflict decisions, background commit, and result retention behave
identically to the Web runtime because both adapters call the same `ora-backend` composition.

The configured root is only a creation target. Existing worktree locations are resolved from the stored branch name and `git worktree list --porcelain` when an agent Session starts or loads. Task and project deletion never mutate Git.

## Persistent Paths

The Tauri identifier is `space.ora.desktop`. Tauri's system `app_data_dir` owns all default runtime state:

- SQLite: `app_data_dir/ora.sqlite3`
- Desktop-only configuration: `app_data_dir/config.json`
- Shared user preferences, including developer mode and log level: `app_data_dir/ora.sqlite3`, table `user_config`
- Logs: `app_data_dir/logs/ora.log`
- Default new-worktree root: `~/.ora/worktrees`
- Session history: `app_data_dir/sessions`
 - Skill packages root: `app_data_dir/atoms/skills`

On first launch, Desktop creates the app data directory, `~/.ora/worktrees`, and a versioned configuration file using an atomic sibling-temporary-file replacement. `config.json` currently holds version `1`, `worktreeRoot`, `dashboardHost`, and `dashboardPort`; it does not store the log level. Existing malformed, unknown-version, or otherwise invalid configuration is fatal; Desktop does not silently reset it.

`ORA_DATA_DIR` controls Desktop's runtime data root. `task run:desktop` points it at the repo `.data` directory so Desktop shares the web server's database. Relative project roots stored in that database are resolved against the data directory's parent (the repo root), not the Tauri process cwd — `tauri dev` starts in `apps/desktop/src-tauri`, which would otherwise miss paths such as `.data/rustun`. Without `ORA_DATA_DIR`, runtime data paths come from Tauri's `app_data_dir`; the first-run worktree root remains `~/.ora/worktrees`, and folder-picker selections are already absolute. `ORA_LOG_LEVEL` configures logging behavior only and does not change any persistent path.

The worktree root is non-sensitive configuration. Users can change it from Settings → Data & privacy on Desktop. A selected value must be an absolute path to an existing directory. The new value affects task creations that start after the update; in-flight operations retain their original snapshot, and existing worktrees are not moved.

The configured root is only a creation target. Existing worktree locations are resolved from the stored branch name and `git worktree list --porcelain` when an agent Session starts or loads, and `resolve_task_cwd` exposes that same resolution to the shell. Task and project deletion never mutate Git. See [Task Worktrees](task-worktrees.md).

## Logging

Desktop first initializes `ora-logging` provisionally from `ORA_LOG_LEVEL` or `info`, preserving migration and bootstrap diagnostics. It then opens and migrates Backend, reads `user_config.log_level`, and reloads the filter before constructing managed state when no environment override exists. The final precedence is `ORA_LOG_LEVEL`, the SQLite preference, then `info`. Environment values are trimmed and ASCII-case-insensitive; an unsupported environment or malformed persisted value fails startup. Logs rotate daily and retain three files. Debug builds write to stdout and the file; release builds write to the file only. The logging guard remains managed for the application lifetime.

Settings always exposes an Advanced category containing the shared developer-mode switch. When enabled, Settings → Developer options appears and contains the log-level selector. The selector calls `get_runtime_log_level` and `set_runtime_log_level` over Tauri and displays the current effective level without exposing environment-variable details. Both commands enter their request span before reading or updating manager state. A successful set reloads the process-wide filter immediately and atomically upserts `user_config.log_level`; its internal transaction finishes updating the cache or performing rollback even if the invoking request stops waiting. If persistence fails, Desktop rolls the effective filter back and returns the primary failure when possible; a rollback failure is recorded separately. Developer mode controls UI discoverability only and is not an authorization boundary.

Only future events are affected. The Desktop build's stdout/file mode, `app_data_dir/logs/ora.log` path, JSON shape, daily rotation, three-day retention, operating-system timezone, and writer workers remain unchanged.

`task run:desktop` maps its optional `LOG_LEVEL` Task variable to `ORA_LOG_LEVEL` and defaults it to `debug` for development. That environment exists only for the Task process and its children: after the Task exits, a later launch does not inherit the previous explicit level unless the parent shell or operating system independently defines it.

Each unary command or stream emits at most one request-completion event using the same request id as
its public failure payload or error frame. Cancellation is completed at `DEBUG` and is not projected
as `internal_error`. Git worktree and branch cleanup after a failed task creation or a deletion is
never attempted inline: it is queued as a durable `git_cleanup` job and executed later by the shared
backend cleanup worker (see [Task Worktrees](task-worktrees.md)), so the primary response and source
chain are unaffected by how that later cleanup turns out. The worker logs its own outcomes under
`operation = "git_cleanup"`, independent of the originating request id.

At startup, Desktop reads the operating system's IANA timezone and fixes it for the process
lifetime. Structured event timestamps use that timezone. If the system timezone cannot be read or
parsed, Desktop records a warning, uses UTC, and continues startup. A system timezone change takes
effect after Ora restarts. Daily log files continue to rotate at UTC boundaries.

## Verification

The Tauri Rust crate keeps its own `Cargo.lock` and is intentionally excluded from the root Cargo workspace. `task test:desktop` checks the Desktop transport, formatting, Clippy, and the independent Rust tests. `task test` includes this task explicitly.
